<h2 style="margin: 0;">About:</h2>
<i>This program creates custom Windows 10 tiles. This copyright program has the Apache License 2.0 and was created by
    BenSvK. The application was
    intended to open-source usage.</i>
<h3>Program features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Creates the 'VisualManifestElements.xml' file inside of an exe file directory with user requirements. Such as
        background tile color, custom user image (70x70 or 150x150) or enables the title of an application on a large
        tile.<br><br>
    <li>Creates the 'Icons' folder inside of the exe file directory with occasional images of the application. This
        folder is being created only if a user requires an own application image.<br><br>
    <li>The program saves its local settings into the <i>%AppData%\WindowsTileCreator</i> folder as save.properties.
        This feature is smart for quick loading your previous settings.<br><br>
</ul>
